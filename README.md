    This project aims to improve the safety of railway crossings by implementing a system that controls traffic signals, barriers, and alerts. The system uses a combination of video input devices and control devices to detect and manage objects on the railway crossing. The project also includes an API to facilitate the integration of the system with other services.

## Installation

    Follow these steps to set up the Railway Crossing Safety Control System:

    1. Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:

       python --version

       or

       python3 --version

    2. Install `pipenv` if you don't have it installed. You can do this by running the following command:

       pip install pipenv

    3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-crossing-safety-control.git
       cd railway-crossing-safety-control

       Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `railway-crossing-safety-control` with the repository name (if different).

    4. Install the project dependencies using `pipenv`:

       pipenv install

    5. Activate the virtual environment:

       pipenv shell

    6. Replace the placeholder `your_openai_api_key` in `main.py` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

    With the virtual environment activated, run the `main.py` script:

       python main.py

    This will execute the Railway Crossing Safety Control System, which will perform the following operations based on the video input data:

    1. Lower the barriers to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from crossing the railway.
    2. Sound an alert to warn nearby vehicles and pedestrians.
    3. Report the situation to the traffic control center, requesting immediate action.

    Please note that the `main.py` script in this example uses simulated image input data. You will need to replace it with actual image input data from your video input devices.
